  abstract = {A previously defined automatic method is applied to reanalysis and
	present-day (1950-1989) forced simulations of the ECHO-G model in
	order to assess its performance in reproducing atmospheric blocking
	in the Northern Hemisphere. Unlike previous methodologies, critical
	parameters and thresholds to estimate blocking occurrence in the
	model are not calibrated with an observed reference, but objectively
	derived from the simulated climatology. The choice of model dependent
	parameters allows for an objective definition of blocking and corrects
	for some intrinsic model bias, the difference between model and observed
	thresholds providing a measure of systematic errors in the model.
	The model captures reasonably the main blocking features (location,
	amplitude, annual cycle and persistence) found in observations, but
	reveals a relative southward shift of Eurasian blocks and an overall
	underestimation of blocking activity, especially over the Euro-Atlantic
	sector. Blocking underestimation mostly arises from the model inability
	to generate long persistent blocks with the observed frequency. This
	error is mainly attributed to a bias in the basic state. The bias
	pattern consists of excessive zonal winds over the Euro-Atlantic
	sector and a southward shift at the exit zone of the jet stream extending
	into in the Eurasian continent, that are more prominent in cold and
	warm seasons and account for much of Euro-Atlantic and Eurasian blocking
	errors, respectively. It is shown that other widely used blocking
	indices or empirical observational thresholds may not give a proper
	account of the lack of realism in the model as compared with the
	proposed method. This suggests that in addition to blocking changes
	that could be ascribed to natural variability processes or climate
	change signals in the simulated climate, attention should be paid
	to significant departures in the diagnosis of phenomena that can
	also arise from an inappropriate adaptation of detection methods
	to the climate of the model.},

	The longwave radiation parameterizations tested were found to have

	choice of boundary conditions, have an impact on the results as large
	as the selection of parameterizations. The range of variability in

	However, their role when projecting future climate is still poorly

	processes, particularly the contribution of soil moisture, when projecting
	future changes for temperature, precipitation and wind over a complex
	area as the Iberian Peninsula, which, in addition, shows great sensitivity
	to climate change. The main signals are found for the summer season,
	when the results indicate a strengthening in the increases projected
	for both mean temperature and temperature variability as a consequence
	of the future intensification of the positive soil moisture-temperature
	feedback. The more severe warming over the inner dry Iberian Peninsula
	further implies an intensification of the Iberian thermal low and,
	thus, of the cyclonic circulation. Furthermore, the land-atmosphere
	coupling leads to the projection of a wider future daily temperature
	range, since maximum temperatures are more affected than minima,
	a feature absent in non-coupled simulations. Regarding variability,
	the areas where the land-atmosphere coupling introduces larger changes
	are those where the reduction in the soil moisture content is more
	dramatic in future simulations, i.e., the so-called transitional
	zones. As regards precipitation, weaker positive signals for convective
	precipitation and more intense negative signals for non-convective
	precipitation are obtained as a result of the soil moisture-atmosphere
	interactions. These results highlight the crucial contribution of
	soil moisture to climate change projections and suggest its plausible

	and European climate. We thus present an alternative approach to
	reconstruct climate for the pre-instrumental period based on the

	indicate that more than 50% of the total summer temperature variability

	mode is related to a more meridional circulation at the upper tropospheric
	levels, which favours local land-sea contrasts in the associated
	local temperature pattern. Variations of this mode are found to be
	responsible for the occurrence of extreme events and decadal trends
	in regional temperature, the latter being characterized by a cooling
	in the early 1960s and a warming in the early 1990s. The second canonical
	mode pictures variations in the intensity of the zonal circulation
	over the Atlantic area that drive temperature anomalies affecting

	the potential of statistical downscaling for Greek summer temperature

	January-to-April air temperature for Stockholm (Sweden) and seasonal
	temperature for a Central European region, both derived from the
	analysis of documentary sources and long instrumental records, are
	compared with the output of climate simulations with the model ECHO-G.
	The analysis is complemented by comparisons with the long (early)-instrumental
	record of Central England Temperature (CET). Both approaches to study
	past climates (simulations and reconstructions) are burdened with
	uncertainties. The main objective of this comparative analysis is
	to identify robust features and weaknesses in each method which may
	help to improve models and reconstruction methods. The results indicate
	a general agreement between simulations obtained with temporally
	changing external forcings and the reconstructed Stockholm and CET
	records for the multi-centennial temperature trend over the recent
	centuries, which is not reproduced in a control simulation. This
	trend is likely due to the long-term change in external forcing.
	Additionally, the Stockholm reconstruction and the CET record also
	show a clear multi-decadal warm episode peaking around AD 1730, which
	is absent in the simulations. Neither the reconstruction uncertainties
	nor the model internal climate variability can easily explain this
	difference. Regarding the interannual variability, the Stockholm
	series displays, in some periods, higher amplitudes than the simulations
	but these differences are within the statistical uncertainty and
	further decrease if output from a regional model driven by the global
	model is used. The long-term trend of the CET series agrees less
	well with the simulations. The reconstructed temperature displays,
	for all seasons, a smaller difference between the present climate
	and past centuries than is seen in the simulations. Possible reasons
	for these differences may be related to a limitation of the traditional
	'indexing' technique for converting documentary evidence to temperature
	values to capture long-term climate changes, because the documents
	often reflect temperatures relative to the contemporary authors'
	own perception of what constituted 'normal' conditions. By contrast,
	the amplitude of the simulated and reconstructed inter-annual variability
	agrees rather well.},

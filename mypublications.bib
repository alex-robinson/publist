abstract = {The Greenland Ice Sheet (GIS), like many elements in the climate system, is expected to exhibit hysteresis behaviour. This implies that for certain conditions, the GIS may have more than one stable state (for example ice-free and fully glaciated states). Several recent studies have confirmed that multistability exists for the GIS and that increasing temperatures could lead to an irreversible decline in ice sheet volume. However, the global temperature anomaly that would cause this decline is not well known. We use the regional energy-moisture balance model REMBO coupled to the ice sheet model SICOPOLIS to investigate the stability of the GIS on long timescales. An important advantage of this approach is that it explicitly accounts for elevation and albedo feedbacks that are critical for proper representation of the evolution of the climate over the ice sheet. In addition, the model parameters have been constrained by paleo and present-day data. Our results indicate that the GIS is significantly more sensitive to climate change than previously estimated. We also present refined estimates of the temperature threshold leading to a collapse of the ice sheet. Until now, this estimate has been based on the fact that when the surface mass balance of the ice sheet becomes negative, the ice sheet is no longer sustainable. While in this case, the ice sheet will certainly disappear, we also find that this condition is not necessary for the ice sheet to melt nonetheless. Furthermore, a large portion of the uncertainty associated with the estimate of this threshold can be attributed to the sensitivity of the surface mass balance model used - something that has not been accounted for until now. We also investigate the question of irreversibility in the decline of the GIS after the threshold has been crossed. We apply cooler temperatures to a partially melted ice sheet and allow it to run to equilibrium. In agreement with others, we find that intermediate states of the ice sheet are possible (aside from the ice-free and fully glaciated states). However, for warmer equilibrium temperatures, an irreversible collapse of the ice sheet becomes more likely.},

abstract = {The Pliocene-Pleistocene transition (PPT, ca. 3.3-2.4 Ma BP) marks a shift in the Earth's climate and is believed to coincide with the inception of the Northern Hemisphere (NH) ice sheets. This transition is not only characterized by a gradual reduction in atmospheric CO2 concentration, paleo records also show a strengthening in the amplitude of $\delta$18O data and intensified ice rafted debris deposition in the North Atlantic. Previous modeling studies have demonstrated that the drop in atmospheric CO2 plays an important role in the glaciation of the NH ice sheets, and more specifically, it is considered to be the primary cause of the glaciation of Greenland. Here we apply a novel approach to produce transient simulations of the entire PPT, in order to study the glaciation of Greenland and the NH ice sheets and additionally, to investigate which conditions are necessary for full-scale glaciation. The fully-coupled Earth system model of intermediate complexity CLIMBER-2 is used to explore the effects of a suite of orbital and CO2 forcing scenarios on total NH glaciation. CLIMBER-2 includes low-resolution sub-models of the atmosphere, vegetation, ocean and ice sheets – the latter is designed to simulate the big NH ice sheets with a rather low resolution (and high computational efficiency). As a refinement, the results of the global simulations are then used to force regional simulations of the Greenland Ice Sheet (GIS) using the higher resolution (20 km) regional climate-ice sheet model, REMBO-SICOPOLIS. We present results of transient simulations driven by orbital forcing and several CO2 reduction scenarios that are consistent with best estimates from data for this time period. We discuss the growth and persistence of the NH ice sheets in terms of the forcing and feedbacks involved. Additionally, we present a set of simulations with the growth of the NH ice sheets disabled, in order to quantify the effect the large ice sheets have on global and regional temperature anomalies. By simulating the Greenland Ice Sheet (GIS) in our high resolution coupled global-regional approach, we identify with greater precision, the conditions neccesary for inception of the GIS and link these to global climatic changes.},

abstract = {Positive degree-day (PDD) models have commonly been used to approximate continental ice sheet surface melt for the last two decades. The approach is advantageous in that it approximates present-day surface melt reasonably well and it is computationally very efficient. However, the empirical coefficients used to translate PDDs into melt are tuned to present-day conditions and thus may not be appropriate for use under other orbital configurations. Here we explore to what extent the current formulation of a PDD melt equation affects melt estimates for different levels of orbital-scale insolation changes. We find that insolation anomalies can cause large discrepancies between melt calculated using PDDs and using a simple energy-balance equation. However, higher temperatures reduce the effect of the insolation anomaly since its relative importance decreases in the energy balance. We introduce a correction factor for the PDD model that accounts for changes in insolation and improves the agreement of melt estimated by the two different methods. A particular feature of this factor is that it is fully consistent with current PDD models for present-day insolation. The new insolation-corrected PDD formulation is further tested with transient simulations of the Greenland ice sheet for the Eemian.},

We compare the number of observed records with those expected in a stationary climate, for which the simple 1/n relationship holds, with n the number of previous years. We also develop a theoretical model to quantify the contributions of climate change and natural variability to the occurrence of records. Worldwide the number of monthly heat records is now 5 times larger than expected in a stationary climate, indicating that record-breaking heat waves lasting for several weeks now have an 80\% chance of being due to climatic warming. Some tropical regions have seen an even larger increase in the number of record breaking events, pushing the probability that a record event is due to climatic warming to more than 90\%. The high number of observed records is well explained by a model assuming linear warming over the last 40 years.},

abstract = {The Greenland ice sheet is highly responsive to climatic changes. At present, it is stable, even given that summer temperatures on the ice sheet induce melting over large areas. With global warming, surface melt will increase substantially and it is likely that Greenland will provide a significant contribution to sea level rise in the future. For this reason it is important to understand the sensitivity of the ice sheet to changes in surface forcing on long time scales. We use a coupled climate-ice sheet modelling approach to gain insight into the long-term stability of the Greenland ice sheet. An intermediate complexity regional climate model is coupled to a 3-D thermo-mechanical ice sheet model via a surface energy balance model. This approach allows us to capture key feedbacks concerning the climate and surface mass balance that are related to the stability of the ice sheet. Additionally, due to the computational efficiency of the model, we are able to perform ensembles of simulations with many model versions. We will present results from simulations over several past glacial cycles, including MIS-11 and the Eemian when Greenland is believed to have contributed substantially to sea levels above present day. These results, which also helped constrain the model versions in comparison with paleo data, will be related to the overall stability of the ice sheet and it’s potential contribution to sea level rise in the future.},

abstract = {The Greenland Ice Sheet (GIS) contains enough water volume to raise global sea level by over 7 meters. It is a relic of past glacial climates that could be strongly affected by a warming world. Several studies have been performed to investigate the sensitivity of the ice sheet to changes in climate, but large uncertainties in its long-term response still exist. In this thesis, a new approach has been developed and applied to modeling the GIS response to climate change. The advantages compared to previous approaches are (i) that it can be applied over a wide range of climatic scenarios (both in the deep past and the future), (ii) that it includes the relevant feedback processes between the climate and the ice sheet and (iii) that it is highly computationally efficient, allowing simulations over very long timescales. The new regional energy-moisture balance model (REMBO) has been developed to model the climate and surface mass balance over Greenland and it represents an improvement compared to conventional approaches in modeling present-day conditions. Furthermore, the evolution of the GIS has been simulated over the last glacial cycle using an ensemble of model versions. The model performance has been validated against field observations of the present-day climate and surface mass balance, as well as paleo information from ice cores. The GIS contribution to sea level rise during the last interglacial is estimated to be between 0.5-4.1 m, consistent with previous estimates. The ensemble of model versions has been constrained to those that are consistent with the data, and a range of valid parameter values has been defined, allowing quantification of the uncertainty and sensitivity of the modeling approach. Using the constrained model ensemble, the sensitivity of the GIS to long-term climate change was investigated. It was found that the GIS exhibits hysteresis behavior (i.e., it is multi-stable under certain conditions), and that a temperature threshold exists above which the ice sheet transitions to an essentially ice-free state. The threshold in the global temperature is estimated to be in the range of 1.3-2.3°C above preindustrial conditions, significantly lower than previously believed. The timescale of total melt scales non-linearly with the overshoot above the temperature threshold, such that a 2°C anomaly causes the ice sheet to melt in ca. 50,000 years, but an anomaly of 6°C will melt the ice sheet in less than 4,000 years. The meltback of the ice sheet was found to become irreversible after a fraction of the ice sheet is already lost – but this level of irreversibility also depends on the temperature anomaly.},

abstract = {We present an approach to reducing the uncertainty in simulations of the future Greenland Ice Sheet (GIS) contribution to sea level rise, associated with the parameterization of the surface mass balance. Many ice sheet models employ relatively simple, semi-empirical approximations to determine surface mass balance, which may not perform as well for different climates and ice sheet topographies. As an alternative approach, we use the regional energy-moisture balance model REMBO to determine the climate and surface mass balance of the GIS, which is also coupled bi-directionally to the 3D polythermal ice sheet model SICOPOLIS. Calculation of the surface mass balance is performed with two different surface mass balance schemes: the classical positive degree day scheme and a more physically-based approach that, in addition to the temperature dependence of melting, includes shortwave solar radiation in the melt scheme. In both approaches, a daily timestep applies, facilitating the calculation of seasonal albedo changes that can feedback on the climate and affect surface melting. It has already been shown that both approaches can simulate present-day GIS forcing reasonably well, yet they differ in sensitivity to changes in temperature and insolation. In order to use paleoclimate information to better constrain model parameters, we performed a set of transient simulations over the last few glacial cycles. The REMBO model was driven by output of the CLIMBER2 model and variations in orbital forcing. With a given set of ice sheet model parameters, the mass balance scheme parameters were varied over a wide range. Comparing the results to estimates of the contribution of the GIS to sea level rise during the Eemian interglacial, in combination with present-day GIS topography and mass balance information, allows us to reduce the uncertainty range in model parameters and, therefore, in the sensitivity of the GIS to temperature changes.},

abstract = {An understanding of the dynamics of the Greenland ice sheet is fundamental, because of its potential to contribute strongly to future sea level rise. In recent years there has been a discussion about the role of the ocean in the Greenland ice sheet’s present and future mass balance. The ocean interacts with the ice sheet’s outlet glaciers via the water circulation in the fjords and considerably affects melting at the termini of the outlet glaciers. Processes related to this interaction are difficult to represent in Greenland-wide ice-sheet models because grid resolution of such models is typically 10 km, whereas large fjords are more commonly only 1 to 5 km wide. Local refinement techniques (e.g. finite elements with adaptive mesh) can be a way of addressing that problem but are still computationally expensive to run. Here we propose a simpler, statistical-dynamical approach suited for large ensemble simulations over 100- to 1000-year integration times, in the EMIC spirit: the fjord-outlet glacier system is restricted to its most fundamental dynamics, controlled by a handful of parameters describing the major characteristics of the system. The model has a generic structure, i.e. it is designed such that it applies to every Greenland outlet glacier. Some of its parameters are fixed by using the (little) available observational data – e.g. for Helheim, Kangerdlugssuaq and Jakobshavn Isbrae – other parameters may vary depending on location. It is not our aim to simulate every single small outlet glacier in its full accuracy; but we aim to represent, on average, important characteristics like ice discharge and general advance/retreat rate on a regional scale over major catchment areas. Aspects of the coupling strategy with the 3D ice-sheet model (SICOPOLIS) are discussed, e.g., critical issues such as the treatment of mass balance. Preliminary design and results will be presented.},

abstract = {We use the regional energy-moisture balance model REMBO coupled to the ice sheet model SICOPOLIS to investigate the stability of the Greenland Ice Sheet (GIS) on long timescales. Using this approach, we are able to simulate the equilibrium response of the ice sheet to various levels of global warming for several model realizations. This provides the unique opportunity to evaluate criteria that can be used to estimate the long term stability of the ice sheet. For example, we ﬁnd that the total surface mass balance (SMB) of the GIS is positively biased by high accumulation rates in the Southeast. Since this quantity has been used until now as the criterion for stability, the critical threshold in temperature leading to complete melting of the GIS has likely been overestimated by approximately 1 degree C. Several useful alternatives exist that provide more accurate indicators of when the threshold will be crossed. These include the regional SMB, the equilibrium line altitude and the cumulative melt area. We focus here on the cumulative melt area (CMA, the sum of the melt area of each day over the year), because it is directly observable and reacts quickly to climatic forcing. A time series of this quantity is available for the period 1979-present based on satellite data. Furthermore, regional climate models (RCMs) have been used to extend the time series back to 1958. This allows a direct comparison of REMBO to the RCMs. For the average from 1958-2001, we ﬁnd very good agreement between the REMBO and RCM estimates of both the daily melt area throughout the melt season and the CMA. The estimate of the present-day CMA using REMBO is somewhat uncertain, depending on the model version used. However, we show that the threshold CMA value leading to complete melting of the GIS is largely invariant (i.e. independent of the model version) and, thus, it can be used as a reliable indicator of stability. Under global warming, a quadratic increase in CMA is predicted. Based on recent trends from the satellite data and RCMs, it is likely that Greenland will cross the threshold within the next 1-2 decades.},

abstract = {Increasing temperatures have recently increased both the melt area and mass loss of the Greenland Ice Sheet. With more anthropogenic CO2 emissions, this trend will continue. Even if emissions are reduced in the future, global temperatures will likely remain high for millennia, which can lead to irreversible melting of the Greenland Ice Sheet. To assess this problem, we have performed long time-scale simulations of the Greenland Ice Sheet using the Earth system model of intermediate complexity CLIMBER-2 fully coupled to the regional climate-ice sheet model REMBO-SICOPOLIS. The model is forced by various future CO2 emissions scenarios that peak in the next centuries. The temperature anomalies driving the high-resolution regional climate and ice sheet model thus include both the temperature increase over the next centuries and the subsequent decline over the next millennia. Freshwater forcing to the North Atlantic and any reduction in area of the Greenland Ice Sheet can feedback into the global climate. Using an ensemble of model versions with perturbed physical parameters that control both the climate sensitivity and sensitivity of the ice sheet to climate change, we investigate the reaction of the Greenland Ice Sheet to the long-term global warming. We consider the potential thresholds in cumulative carbon emissions that lead to disappearance or signiﬁcant melting of the Greenland ice sheet. Through these simulations we are able to calculate a probability of decline for each scenario as well as estimate the time scale of mass loss.},

Here we analyze record-breaking events in the last decade using global gridded datasets of monthly-mean surface temperature and precipitation. We compare the number of observed records with those expected in a stationary climate, for which the simple 1/n relationship holds, with n the number of previous data points (e.g. years). In addition, we develop a first-order theoretical model to quantify the respective contributions of climate change and natural variability to the occurrence of records. World wide the number of monthly heat records is now, on average 5 times larger than expected in a stationary climate. This indicates that record-breaking heat waves lasting for several weeks now have, on average, an 80\% chance of being due to climatic warming. Some tropical regions including East-Africa, India and Amazonia have seen an even larger increase in the number of record breaking events, pushing the probability that a record event is due to climatic warming to more than 90\%. The high number of observed records is well explained by a model assuming a linear warming over the last 40 years. Precipitation extremes are more complex than heat extremes as different physical processes associated with global warming are likely to affect them. Warmer air can hold more moisture and thus, in principle, enhances extremes in both rainfall maxima and minima. Also, changes in wind patterns will affect precipitation and it is expected that dry areas will become drier and wet areas wetter. We show that, globally averaged the number of observed records, both for minima and maxima, are not significantly different from those expected in a stationary climate. Still, large regions have seen an up to threefold increase in the number of rainfall records, where others have seen drought records increase by a similar magnitude. We discuss possible physical mechanisms behind the observed patterns.},

abstract = {Marine and continental records and ice core data have revealed the existence of pronounced millennial time-scale climate variability during the last glacial cycle. Greenland ice core records show abrupt transitions known as Dansgaard-Oeschger (DO) events within decades from cold (stadial) to relatively warm (interstadial) conditions, followed by slow cooling that lasts several centuries and more rapid cooling through stadial conditions. Two types of explanation have been suggested: periodic external forcing and internal oscillations in the climate system, for which ocean circulation is the main candidate. On the other hand, six periods of extreme cooling registered in the Northern Hemisphere, known as Heinrich events, have been found to be coeval with increased deposition of ice-rafted debris, which is interpreted as enhanced discharge of icebergs into the North Atlantic Ocean. Recently, the coupled effects between ocean circulation and ice-sheets dynamics have been suggested to play a major role in triggering Heinrich events. This interpretation of Heinrich events responding to changes in the oceanic patterns (or at least not being purely internal and spontaneous manifestations of ice sheets), allows the possibility to provide an explicit relationship between DO events and the periodic iceberg surges. Here this hypothesis is reassessed within a more realistic modeling framework by forcing a 3D state-ofthe-art ice-sheet model with the output of abrupt climate change simulations carried out with a coupled climate model of intermediate complexity. These show the main expected characteristics of such events: an abrupt warming of the North Atlantic and Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) intensiﬁcation followed by a progressive cooling and AMOC reduction, as well as a more drastic fall into a stadial condition. Interestingly, stadial periods are characterized by the occurrence of subsurface oceanic warming of up to 3 K in regions where deep water formation takes place (Nordic and Labrador Seas). We show that subsurface warming is a crucial mechanism to destabilize the Labrador Sea ice shelves favoring the acceleration of the Laurentide ice streams. Iceberg production is then enhanced during stadial periods. However, this pattern is not monotonically present through all DO events: the combination of both a characteristic ice-shelf break-up and re-developing time larger than the DO forcing period and the fact that ice-streams need to ﬂow extremely fast to create major calving rates explains the different magnitude of iceberg discharge during different stadial periods. Finally, when applying a time-evolving basal melt rate of the Labrador ice shelf calibrated (in anti-phase) against the GRIP curve, the ice sheet models produces ice discharges that compare well with ice rafted debris records. These results suggest that oceanic forcing can be considered as a sufﬁcient condition for triggering the observed millennial-scale ice discharges, including Heinrich events.},

abstract = {Ice discharge and surface melt are the most important elements of the Greenland ice sheet (GIS) stability; both currently contribute about equally to the present ice loss of the GIS. Nowadays it is becoming more and more clear that for an explicit representation of ice-ocean marginal processes (outlet glaciers, fjord dynamics, calving) current modeling approaches are probably not adequate and that the present topographical data sets are of insufﬁcient resolution to describe these small-scale ice marginal processes. But the ability to adequately capture the relevant processes leading to ice loss of the GIS is tremendously important for understanding the role of the GIS in a changing world under global warming. As a preliminary attempt to resolve these challenges we introduce a new parameterization of ice discharge, which has been recently included in the coupled regional climate-ice sheet model REMBO-SICOPOLIS. Here, the ice discharge from the major hydrological basins of the GIS are explicitly considered and the model parameters are adjusted to ﬁt observational data, in particular to data on ice discharge. We compare standard large-scale modeling approaches with our new approach. Steady-state as well as transient simulations under future warming scenarios are performed and discussed. In particular, we demonstrate the impact of our new approach on the stability behavior if the GIS.},
